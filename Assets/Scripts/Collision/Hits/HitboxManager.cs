// Separate from the physics server: boxes are frame data, not physics objects, and only share its overlap math.
// Ticked right after physics, so it sees every character's final position for the tick.
//
// Gathers every active hit and hurt box once, then checks each hitbox against every other owner's hurtboxes.
// Everything runs in player number order, then box order, so every machine resolves the same hits.
// All hits are found before any are applied, so two characters hitting each other on the same tick both land.
// Holds no state between ticks. What each hit group has already hit lives in the attacker's HitGroups, so it rolls back
// Owned by the DeterministicWorld
